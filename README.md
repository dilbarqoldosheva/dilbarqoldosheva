### Glad to see you here!  
Power-packed with the strengths of data structures and algorithms. I can perform modifications in various software, according to client requirements, by applying the principles of computer science, with the goal of optimising an application for better performance delivery.

I can create client-facing apps and websites with cutting-edge back-end support. I have worked with modern tools including Next.js, React.js, MongoDB, Node, Express.js, Firebase and Postman. I usually use the MERN stack, but I'm flexible enough to utilize whatever tools are required.

I am a collaborative person but sometimes I get nervous and self-conscious in social situations. Also I enjoy making people around me laugh.

### Technologies I have previously worked with:

- JavaScript, C/C++, HTML, CSS 3, Python, Pug, Sass, Bootstrap 
- Popular Python libraries, including pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and many more.
- MERN Stack (MongoDB, ExpressJS, ReactJS, NodeJS) and Next.js
- CSS frameworks and libraries like Material UI, Bootstrap, Tailwind CSS
- CMS such as Strapi and Sanity
